wizard:
	
	-	A "wizard" in computing is something that guides the user through a sequence of steps to accomplish some process. 
	
Devleopment Board:

	-	PCB with the fpga chip which includes other devices that are use to check design.
	
		>	example devices include LEDs, Seven Segment Displays, Switches, etc.
		
	-	If you have a Microprocessor that is part of the design.
	
Synthesis:

	-	The process of converting a high level description into a netlist.
	
	- 	The description is typically RTL code (Data flow level of abstraction).
	
	-	A constraint file is required.
	
	-	Architectural description is you system specification.
